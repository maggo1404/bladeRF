 2014.12-rc1 (2014-12-23)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release candidate introduces some minor additions to libbladeRF and the
bladeRF-cli program. See the CHANGELOG items associated with these items for
more details.

This release consists of the following versions:
    * FPGA bitstream v0.1.2
    * FX3 firmware v1.8.0
    * libbladeRF v1.1.0
    * bladeRF-cli v1.1.0

Major changes include:
    * Introduction of libbladeRF support for bootloader detection and recovery.
      With this change, the Cypress backend should now be fully-functional.
    * Added libbladeRF file search path options (e.g., for host-based FPGA
      autoloading).
    * Moved message about detecting devices in bootloader mode to bladeRF-cli.
      This was original printed by some lower-level libbladeRF code, and deemed
      more appropriately located in the bladeRF-cli program.

The following tracker items have been closed since the 2014.11 release:

    * Enhancement requests:
        - #361: Make bladeRF-cli --probe vary its exit status based on whether
                a device was found or not
        - #359: [libbladeRF] Migrate bootloader recovery support to libbladeRF
        - #349: [libbladeRF] Add current directory and env vars to file search

 2014.11 (2014-11-30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This release introduces a stable libbladeRF API and various fixes.

No further reverse-incompatible API changes are currently scheduled. Should such
changes be required in the future, they will be denoted through a major version
number increment.

This release consists of the following versions:
    * FPGA bitstream v0.1.2
    * FX3 firmware v1.8.0
    * libbladeRF v1.0.0
    * bladeRF-cli v1.0.0


Major fixes include:
    * libbladeRF now waits for SPI flash autoloading to complete when
      opening a device. This requires FX3 Firmware v1.8.0.
    * FPGA v0.1.2 includes fixes in timestamp functionality.
    * An issue causing SPI flash corruption when using libusb with the WinUSB
      driver has been addressed.

 2014.11-rc3 (2014-10-30)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This 2014.11-rc3 release candidate introduces the remaining functionality
originally intended for a 2014.09 release, as well as a number of improvements
and bug fixes. As denoted by the name, the release has been rescheduled for
November 2014.

This release candidate consists of the following versions:
    * FPGA bitstream v0.1.1
    * FX3 firmware v1.7.1
    * libbladeRF v0.17.0
    * bladeRF-cli v0.12.0

Major changes and additions include:
    * Timestamp metadata support for the libbladeRF synchronous interface
        - Example code is included in the API documentation and available
          in the libbladeRF/doc/examples directory.
        - This is tightly-coupled with functionality and fixes introduced
          by FPGA v0.1.1.

    * A majority of libbladeRF functions have been made thread-safe.

    * libbladeRF support for a Cypress CyUSB3/CyAPI-based backend
        - This backend has been found to be a useful alternative on some
          systems with USB3 controllers that exhibit issues with the libusb
          backend implementation.

    * Fixes for LMS DC calibration issues
        - FPGA fixes in v0.1.1 have addressed a timing issue that corrupted
          LMS register readbacks. This fixes issue #269, in which LMS DC
          calibration registers would become corrupted and read back as 31's.
        - A bladeRF-cli change in v0.12.0 fixed issue #304, where TX DC
          calibration would fail, reporting that invalid values were
          encountered.

The remaining window of time up to the first official release is intended for
documentation improvements and bug fixes. New features or major changes will be
held off until the following cycle; they may be staged in a master-next branch
if needed.

The following issue tracker items have been closed since 2014.09-rc2. Issues

 2014.09-rc2 (2014-07-24)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since 2014.09-rc1, there have been a number of bug fixes.  We wanted to ensure
these fixes were provided at a relatively stable "snapshot" in the codebase,
prior to introducing a slightly large of set of internal changes required
to provide the timestamp support and thread-safety.

As such, these changes are have been marked `2014.09-rc2`, and the late-August
milestone has been been renamed to `2014.09-rc3`. The objectives for the
late-August and September and milestones remain.

This release candidate consists of the following versions:
    * FPGA bitstream v0.0.6
    * FX3 firmware v1.7.1
    * libbladeRF v0.16.2
    * bladeRF-cli v0.11.1

In addition to continued fixes and minor improvements, the remaining
major functionality, now scheduled for RC3 is:
    * Metadata/timestamp support for the libbladeRF synchronous interface
    * Experimental Cypress driver-based libbladeRF backend for Windows

The above items will add additional items to the libbladeRF API, but will not
introduce any reverse-incompatible changes.

The items scheduled for deprecation are largely the same since 2014.09-rc1
    * bladeRF-flash has been removed as of 2014.09-rc2
    * libbladeRF's BLADERF_FORMAT_SC16Q11 will be removed prior to 2014.09-rc3

Outstanding tasks and known issues, as of RC2, are listed below. Note that not
all of these are scheduled for resolution by 2014.09. Please see the milestone
and tracker information GitHub for more information.

 2014.09-rc1 (2014-07-05)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first of two release candidates for a 2014-09 release. RC1 consists
of the following component versions:

    FPGA bitstream  v0.0.5
    FX3 Firmware    v1.7.0
    libbladeRF      v0.16.0
    bladeRF-cli     v0.11.0

This release candidate provides a majority of the functionality scheduled for
the 2014.09 release. The remaining functionality, scheduled for RC2 is:

    * Metadata/timestamp support for the libbladeRF synchronous interface
    * Detection and reporting of incompatible firmware/FPGA versions
    * Experimental Cypress driver-based libbladeRF backend for Windows

The above items will add additional items to the libbladeRF API, but will not
introduce any reverse-incompatible changes.


The following items are schedule for deprecation and removal prior to the
2014.09-rc2 release:

    * bladeRF-flash utility
        - A majority of the functionality provided in this program now overlaps
          with bladeRF-cli. This program was used to ease the burden associated
          with some very early firmware upgrades.

          However, for firmware upgrade issues, the well-documented bootloader
          approach is now preferred. This, combined with efforts to have
          libbladeRF be more explicit about version mismatches, should eliminate
          any remaining need for this program.

    * libbladeRF's BLADERF_FORMAT SC16_Q12 reverse compatibility macro
        - The format is now more appropriately named BLADERF_FORMAT_SC16_Q11.
          Ensure you've replaced references to the old enumeration value.


Outstanding tasks and known issues, as of RC1, are listed below. Note that not
all of these are scheduled for resolution by 2014.09. Please see the milestone

        - #265: [hdl] Incorect metadata position in the RX Stream
